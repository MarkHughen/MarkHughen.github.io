Yes, I personally enjoy shiny new things. An organization should have a small team with a wide sandbox to ask effective shiny questions, and a powerful architecture team to cautiously consider and say "no" most of the time. I think both are important.

* [daftcode's essay](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22#.v4hq9nfo1) on HDD with example scenarios.
* [TheNewStack's perspective](http://thenewstack.io/programmers-react-warning-hype-driven-development/) with tons of links both positive and negative.

HDD Examples are discussed in social media: Reddit, conferences, Stack Overflow, Twitter. Daftcode describes the Hype as stages of grief: 

* Real problems - "We need some kind of communication bus to share data between agencies."
* Announcement - "Have you guys heard of this microservices pattern? I saw it on Reddit." 
* Mania - "This will solve all our problems, and revolutionize data sharing in county government."
* Disappointment - "Holy crap it's hard to manage state across the entire network." "Redesigning all the batch programs into tiny services takes a lot of time."
* Realization - Data sharing between organizations is difficult. It involves business product analysis and careful architecture. A framework change by itself doesn't fix everything.
