From [Chales Chu's account](https://medium.com/personal-growth/isaac-asimov-how-to-never-run-out-of-ideas-again-b7bf8e09cc91#.d7ulodur9) of Isaac Asimov's prolific creativity strategies. 

Generate new ideas and never be bored.
<ul>
<li><h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
Read widely. Follow your curiosity. Never stop investing in yourself</li>
<li><h3>Don't Fight the Stuck - <i>and don't fight the suck</i></h3>
<div>Produce content, refine later. There is a time and place for architecture, don't confuse that time with invention.</div>
<div>Chu makes the point that active ignorance creates space for ideas.</div>
</li>
<li><h3>Beware of the Resistance</h3>
Fear and perfectionism robs creativity. Water your wildest idea.</li>
<li><h3>Make MORE Stuff</h3>
Don't constrain your creation to the office.
<div>When you're in the office, don't constrain yourself to a chair. Stand and squat and do push-ups and crawl under the desk. <b>The good ideas are under the desk.</b></li>
</ul>
