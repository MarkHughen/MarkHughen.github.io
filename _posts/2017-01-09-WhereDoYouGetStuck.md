Article from [elidedbraches](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2017/01/how-do-individual-contributors-get.html) identifying processes where programmers often get stuck on projects.

_Can organizational skunk work groups help here? Create non-trivial and transactional projects, using best-practice architecture, in sandbox environments for new libraries and frameworks. Also write best-practice code generators to simplify architectural priorities - nice if these also include unit tests._

<ul>
<li>Brainstorming/architecture: "I must identify all edge cases before beginning." This is in direct conflict with rapid development concepts.</li>
<li>Researching every possible solution. Hopefully skunk work groups help out by pre-baking potential candidates.</li>
<li>Refactoring: cleaner code and renaming projects can go forever.</li>
<li>Excessive testing (rare): In fact, additional unit testing can be a solution, pulling out of stickiness.</li>
<li>Excessive automation (also rare): Again project group might write automations and code generators to save this item.</li>
</ul>

Teach team leads to bureaucracy navigation, surprise smoothing, and bad guy "no saying." These skills should be their expertise. Also teach them the "superpower" of identifying sticky situations and solutions.
