Is there value for programmers to know Excel? Joel Spolsky thinks there is, and provides a tutorial to help you get better. _Table functionality is worth the watch by itself and learn to use pivot tables._

* Spreadsheets are the first and easiest database we are allowed to access.
* We work with business people, let's help them do better work.

Do you know Spolsky? Check him out: here's his [interview with Scott Hanselman](http://hanselminutes.com/561/checking-in-with-joel-spolsky-who-says-i-suck-at-excel)  and the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/tags/podcasts/).

BTW: don't watch this at normal speed, Spolsky is fascinating and helped develop our beloved StackOverflow, but [hack listening](https://markhughen.github.io/blog/2016/12/13/ListenFaster).
