title: Design Channels - Why Pain Makes a Poor Input Mechanism

In a post-pointer (see [post-WIMPy discussion](https://markhughen.github.io/blog/2016/12/15/BeyondGUI)) environment, software designers can use sensory feedback as an input mechanism. Expanding interaction beyond the visual spectrum offers exciting, and sometimes painful, design possibilities.

Mark Miller discusses feedback channels and UI design in his podcast with [.NET Rocks!](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1378) 

Manipulating cadence, volume, and white space creates emphasis. Miller reminds us that **granularity should match the importance of the message**.

Some channels feel familiar with mobile development practices, although questionable with business applications:
<ul>
<li>Auditory feedback with touch clicks and beeps.</li>
<li>Haptic and proprioceptive tactile feedback are both effective inputs. _Can't wait to try HTC Vive controller_.</li>
</ul>

Others seem more experimental:
<ul>
<li>How close are we to providing access to taste feedback?</li>
<li>Thankfully, deep pain (electrocution) is a poor mechanism due to relatively slow neural response. Remember delayed pain from stubbing your toe.</li>
</ul>
