Clayton Christensen's "Jobs To Be Done" on [Harvard Business Review's](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/12/the-jobs-to-be-done-theory-of-innovation) podcast. His innovation theory says when a consumer requires work, they hire a product which fills their needs. Who hires milkshakes? A morning commuter who needs an easily stored, long-lasting diversion from traffic. Personally, I hired [BulletProof Coffee](https://blog.bulletproof.com/bulletproof-coffee-recipe/) to fill this role admirably.

How do we infer "Jobs To be Done" theory in software development? I have a team of expert JavaScript developers, but prefer the validation security of a static typing system. I hire TypeScript, which transpiles to JavaScript, creating a cross-platform coding environment. [TypeScript is now releasing 2.0](http://thenewstack.io/typescript-2-new-version-javascript-scales/), adding increased typing functionality (from links to DefinitelyTyped repo) and formalized function programming patterns.<br>
