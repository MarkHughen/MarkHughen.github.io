Musician Brian Eno originally created the [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) to help artists break creative blocks indirectly. They are often cryptic, zen-like statements which are useful in many situations; love "*consider burning bridges*."

Traviscj recently posted ["Oblique Programming Strategies."](https://traviscj.com/blog/oblique_programming_strategies.html) Maybe some of these will thaw frozen bugs. Some if my favorites:
<ul>
<li>What is the transitive closure (I had to look this up - reachability matrix) of fields in your data model? How do they compare to the application domain? _this reminds me of experiments with non-relational data stores_</li>
<li>Can performance be improved by batching many small updates?</li>
<li>Write a test for it.</li>
<li>Would it be easier on the client/server side?</li>
<li>Can you codegen the boilerplate? _love this one, please more custom code generation_</li>
</ul>

Many of these remind me of [Tim Ferriss' 17 Questions](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/):
<ul>
<li>What if I did the opposite for 48 hours?</li>
<li>What if I could only subtract to solve problems? _This is a remarkably good strategy when debugging code_</li>
<li>Am I hunting antelope or field mice? _solve big problems_</li>
</ul>
