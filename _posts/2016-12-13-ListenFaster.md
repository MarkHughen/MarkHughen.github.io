**Stop listening to audio playback at normal speed. Hack listening.**

It is possible to listen 3 times faster than the typical speaker's rate of delivery. While this paradox affects attention span during live presentations, manipulating delivery rate during playback increases learning potential.

Use tools on YouTube, podcast players, and MP3 devices which increase playback speed. Practice speed reading for your ears, developing efficiency with escalating rate repetition.
