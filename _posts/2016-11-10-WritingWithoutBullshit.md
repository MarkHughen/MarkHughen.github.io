Josh Bernoff's **Iron Imperitive** - "The user's time is more important than the writer's."<br>
_Notes from his podcast on November 10, 2016._

Reading on a device is hard, you only get 36 seconds of attention. Plan for it<br>
	Be BRIEF, be BOLD, and be CLEAR
		
  * Write short – delete relentlessly
  * Front load the message, start with the conclusion
  * Paragraphs suck – use infographics: bullets, lists, quotes, tables, pictures, links
  * Take responsibility – remove passive voice, jargon, and weasel words (needless intensification and qualification).
  * Plan -> Know readers, what action should readers take

_*This infographic from his website says it all, create skimmable content that respects the reader’s time._<br>
