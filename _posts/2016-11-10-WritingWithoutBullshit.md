Josh Bernoff's *Iron Imperitive* - "The user's time is more important than the writer's." 
_Notes from his podcast on November 10, 2016._

Reading on a device is hard, you only get 36 seconds of attention. Plan for it
		Be BRIEF, be BOLD, and be CLEAR

		o	Write short – delete relentlessly
		o	Front load the message, start with the conclusion
		o	Paragraphs suck – use infographics: bullets, lists, quotes, tables, pictures, links
		o	Take responsibility – remove passive voice, jargon, and weasel words (needless intensification and qualification).
		o	Plan -> Know readers, what action should readers take

_*This infographic from his website says it all, create skimmable content that respects the reader’s time._
