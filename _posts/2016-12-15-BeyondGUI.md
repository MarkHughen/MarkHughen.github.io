This [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/12/15/bots-podcast-with-jon-bruner/) discussion with [O'Reilly Bots Podcast](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-bots-podcast) host Jon Bruner discusses changing design patterns beyond traditional GUI input familiar to web application developers.

>What is WIMP? Common description for mouse-based GUI input, "Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device."
>
>What is post-WIMPy? [This paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/chi08.pdf) calls it "Reality-Based Interaction," or "Natural UI." Includes, but not limited: touch, 3D, AR/VR body awareness, and voice.

Interaction with bots raises other "post-WIMPy" design challenges. In its simplest form, bot applications provide an abstraction for static decision tree functionality.  Deep learning advances in Natural Language Processing enhance the voice input experience further. How can we design a better user experience than frustrating phone IVR's?

Joshua Browder gives an illustration with his "DoNotPay" application which generates parking ticket appeals. The judicial process is full of business processes which may lend themselves to similar decision tree applications.

Let's make cool stuff! <br><br>
